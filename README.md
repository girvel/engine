# Fallen engine

> [!WARNING]
> Alpha version

## Concept

- 2D grid-based graphics
- D&D-like combat & build system
- Autogenerated GUI, internally immediate mode, user defines actions, quests, codex
- Coroutine-based scripting
- [ldump](https://github.com/girvel/ldump)-driven serialization
- LuaLS-compatible

## Setup

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/girvel/engine
echo 'require("engine/kernel/main.lua")' | tee main.lua
love .
```

## Hooks

- `levels.main` is the default level to load
- `player` LuaLS type is user-defined
- each level expects `solids` grid layer and relies on `items`, `tiles`, `on_solids`
